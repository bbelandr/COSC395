# What it is and why it matters
Every decision we make has ethics related to it. It seeks to answer "What is moral," or "How should we live?" It also is an applied branch of philosophy. Most ethics is about what is right or wrong, not what is *legal*.

Ethics is fundamental to the meaning of life.

## Citizens have ethical responsibilities, and professionals have additional ones:
* No deception
* Avoid conflicts of interest
	* There is a difference between an **actual** conflict and **perceived** conflict
* Faithful to client
* Follow ethics guidelines (like [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html), [ACM](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) or the NSPE Fundamental Cannons)

Technical question: **can** we do something?
Ethical question question: **should** it be done?

# Ethical Theory
Normative (or prescriptive) vs Relative (or descriptive)
## Ethical relativism
There are many differences between individuals and groups, so we can't agree on definitions. What is ethical depends on individual and culture.
* Just because one group does things does not make it right

## Utilitarianism
This states that we should act to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. 
* The end will justify the means. 
This idea can be harmful to minorities, however

## Deontological Ethics
This states that acts are primary and carry the moral weight. 
* Has issues because it requires a universal obedience of an ideology or belief. It can also have multiple interpretations
* The means justify the end
* Do what is right, though the world should perish
## Fraud
### Company vs society
Unsafe products, dishonest ads
### Company vs individual
Invasion of employees' privacy
### Company vs company
Honesty in negotiations
### Company vs itself

## Safety Critical Systems
* Accept responsibility for public health and welfare
* Strive for the best quality
* Boeing 737 MAX was not tested extensively enough and caused crashes
## Consideration of Current and Future Impact of Actions
What will be the impact on generations 100, 1000, or 1000000 years from now?
