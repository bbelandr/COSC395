# What is CMOS
They are a form of transistor for building sensors.
What kinds of sensors?
* Electrochemical and pH
* Optical
* Micro/nanofabrication
* Physiological
The idea is to take a large sensor and condense it down to a flat screen
# Optical Sensing
There are a couple kinds of Optical sensing
* Fluorescence Sensing
* Neutron Detecting
* Radiation Detecting
* Lidar
# Electrochemical Sensing
When there is voltage/current and also a chemical reaction going on.
